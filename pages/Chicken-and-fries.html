        <ol>
            <li>Season your meat and flour to taste using the same seasoning for both</li>
            <li>Pour oil in both the frying pan and deep pot to about half their height
                then preheat both pots</li>
            <li>Cut potatos into fries and cover the seasoned chicken with the flour</li>
            <li>Once both pots are hot, put fries into deep pot and the chicken into
                the frying pan
            </li>
            <li>Once the fries are golden brown you can take them out of the pot, place them into 
                a container with paper towels covering the botton to absorb the extra oil, then seasoned
                them to taste using the seasoning salt.
            </li>
            <li>Once the chicken is golden brown on one side you can flip them over. When both sides
                are sufficiently browned, take them out of the pot and place them on a container
                with paper towels covering the bottom.
