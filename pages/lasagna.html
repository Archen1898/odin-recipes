        <h1 class="heading">How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h1>

            <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
            <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="heading">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a 
                Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
                Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 
                1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in 
                boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
                remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 
                9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
                mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, 
                and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray 
                or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake 
                for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
